You are a QA engineer verifying the Brand Portal implementation. Do not implement new features unless something is broken; focus on testing + confirming behavior. Run the app locally in Replit, click through the UI, and report results as a checklist with PASS/FAIL, and short notes for any FAIL (what you saw, where, and what should happen).

⸻

1) Create Campaign wizard (one question at a time popup)

Entry
	•	Navigate to Brand Portal → Campaigns → click “Create Campaign”.
	•	Confirm it opens as a popup/modal wizard.

One-question-per-step behavior

Verify that:
	•	Only one question is visible at a time.
	•	There are clear Next / Back / Cancel controls.
	•	You cannot proceed without completing required fields for the current step.

Base steps (always)

Confirm these appear in order:
	1.	Campaign name
	2.	Campaign objectives
	3.	Start date
	4.	Type of campaign (UGC / Influencer / Hybrid)

Branching validation

If UGC selected:
Confirm wizard shows UGC questions:
	1.	Persona you’re looking for
	2.	Gender
	3.	Age range
	4.	Number of videos

If Influencer selected:
Confirm wizard shows Influencer questions:
	1.	Type of influencer (micro / nano / mid tier / macro / mega)
	2.	Niche
	3.	Budget for creators
	4.	Platforms

If Hybrid selected:
	•	Confirm wizard shows both UGC and Influencer question sets (all steps appear).
	•	Confirm the order is logical and no steps are missing.

Submission
	•	Finish the wizard and create a campaign for each type (UGC, Influencer, Hybrid).
	•	Confirm the created campaign appears in the campaigns list and opens correctly.

Acceptance:
	•	Wizard is modal, one-question-per-step, branching works, required validation blocks Next.

2) Campaign Details → Creators tab (recommended creators + approve/reject + content review)

For a campaign that has admin-recommended creators:

Creators tab content
	•	Open campaign details → go to Creators tab.
	•	Confirm it shows all creator profiles recommended by admin.

Approval flow
	•	Confirm each creator has Approve and Reject buttons.
	•	Click Reject and confirm it requires a reason (why).
	•	Submit rejection and confirm:
	•	creator status updates (Rejected)
	•	reason is visible somewhere appropriate
	•	persists after refresh

Content review moved into Creators tab
	•	Confirm there is no separate content review UI outside the Creators tab.
	•	Confirm any “review content” functionality that existed is now accessible inside Creators tab (per creator).

Acceptance:
	•	Recommended creators visible.
	•	Approve/Reject works.
	•	Reject requires reason.
	•	Content review is handled inside Creators tab.

⸻

3) Remove campaign Content tab (old one)
	•	In campaign details navigation, confirm the Content tab is removed (the old content-review tab).
	•	Confirm there is no broken link/tab.
	•	If a direct route existed, confirm it doesn’t appear in the UI.

Acceptance:
	•	Old campaign Content tab is gone.

⸻

4) Brand Portal Content tab = Saved content analytics only

Navigate to Brand Portal → Content tab.

Verify:
	•	Content tab shows ONLY saved content (bookmarked/archived by brand), not all content submissions.
	•	It displays a list/table including:
	•	Creator name
	•	Views
	•	Likes
	•	Comments
	•	Saves
	•	Shares
	•	Engagement rate

Verify engagement rate:
	•	Confirm engagement rate is displayed per row and doesn’t show NaN/Infinity when views are 0.

Acceptance:
	•	Content tab = saved content analytics only, with required columns.

⸻

5) Report results

Produce a final report:
	•	Checklist with PASS/FAIL for each section above
	•	For FAIL items: specify exact screen, exact issue, and what is missing/wrong
	•	Include any console errors encountered (copy message text)

Do not implement changes unless explicitly requested; this task is verification only.
