You are a senior engineer refactoring the Kreate&Co codebase for maintainability and extensibility. This task is refactor/cleanup only: do not change product behavior or UX (no feature changes), except where required to remove duplication and bugs caused by messy structure. Preserve routes, permissions, and existing flows.

Goals
	•	Make the code modular, consistent, and easy to extend.
	•	Reduce duplication, improve naming, improve folder structure, and unify styling.
	•	Ensure the app still works exactly the same after refactor.

⸻

1) Refactor scope and rules
	•	No behavior changes (same UI output, same logic, same API calls).
	•	Improve structure only: split large files, extract reusable components, standardize patterns.
	•	If you find small bugs caused by refactor opportunities (e.g., duplicated CSS causing layout issues), fix them but document it.

Deliverable: a clean PR-style set of commits with clear messages.

2) Component modularization

Refactor the UI code to:
	•	Break large pages into:
	•	Page component (route-level container)
	•	Sections components (page sections)
	•	Shared components (reusable UI)
	•	Extract repeated UI patterns into reusable components, such as:
	•	Page header (title + actions)
	•	Filter/search toolbar
	•	Table/list view components
	•	Cards (creator card, campaign row)
	•	Modal wrapper + form modal layout
	•	Status badge/pill
	•	Empty state component
	•	Loading skeleton components
	•	Confirm dialog / reason dialog

Guidelines:
	•	Components should be small and single-responsibility.
	•	Avoid prop drilling: use context/hooks if already present and appropriate.
	•	Standardize component API naming and props.

3) Styling cleanup (generalize CSS)

Clean and standardize styling without changing appearance:
	•	Remove inline styles scattered across components (move to reusable classes).
	•	Consolidate duplicated styles into shared styles/utilities.
	•	Standardize spacing, typography, and layout utilities.
	•	Create a single source of truth for:
	•	colors (if used)
	•	spacing scale
	•	typography scale
	•	border radius
	•	shadows
	•	Use the existing styling approach in the repo (Tailwind, CSS modules, styled-components, etc.). Do not introduce a new framework unless the repo already supports it.
	•	Ensure the left sidebar fixed behavior remains intact (do not regress layout).

⸻

4) State management & data fetching cleanup
	•	Standardize data fetching patterns:
	•	Put API calls in one layer (e.g., services/ or api/).
	•	Keep UI components free of direct request logic where possible.
	•	Normalize types/interfaces:
	•	Centralize shared types in a consistent location.
	•	Remove duplicated type definitions.
	•	Extract repeated state logic into custom hooks:
	•	useCampaignsList, useCampaignDetails, useCreatorNetwork, etc. (names can vary)
	•	Ensure consistent error handling and loading state behavior across pages.

⸻

5) Folder structure cleanup

Reorganize the code into a predictable structure (adapt to repo conventions). Example target structure:
	•	src/pages/ (route-level)
	•	src/features/
	•	campaigns/
	•	creator-network/
	•	content-analytics/
	•	src/components/ (shared UI)
	•	src/hooks/
	•	src/api/ or src/services/
	•	src/styles/ (shared styles/tokens)
	•	src/utils/

Rules:
	•	Don’t move files randomly—group by feature and reuse.
	•	Update imports and keep paths clean.

⸻

6) Code quality standards
	•	Enforce consistent naming conventions and file naming.
	•	Remove dead code, unused components, unused CSS.
	•	Reduce component complexity:
	•	limit deeply nested JSX
	•	extract helpers
	•	avoid duplicated conditionals
	•	Add simple comments only where necessary for non-obvious logic.

⸻

7) Testing / verification

After refactor:
	•	Run the app and verify key flows still work:
	•	Campaigns list renders and filters work
	•	Create Campaign wizard works
	•	Campaign details page renders
	•	Creator network section works (search/filter)
	•	Content analytics list renders
	•	Permissions still apply
	•	Fix any regressions caused by refactor.

⸻

8) Output required

At the end, provide:
	•	Summary of refactor changes (bullet list)
	•	Updated folder structure (tree)
	•	Any behavior changes (should be “none”)
	•	Known remaining tech debt if you chose not to touch it

Proceed with the refactor now.
