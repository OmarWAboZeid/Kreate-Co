You are working on the Admin portal → Create Campaign form/wizard. Implement ONLY the changes listed below (no other refactors or unrelated edits). Update UI + validation + API payload + persistence as needed so these fields save correctly and can be used later.

2) Add “Type of campaign” (deal type)

If campaign kind = Influencer
	•	10 videos
	•	15 videos
	•	20 videos
	•	40 videos
	•	Other → show a textbox (required) to capture custom package text

If campaign kind = UGC
	•	4 videos
	•	8 videos
	•	12 videos
	•	20 videos
	•	Other → show a textbox (required) to capture custom package text

	•	Hype bundle (8 UGC, 15 influencer videos)
