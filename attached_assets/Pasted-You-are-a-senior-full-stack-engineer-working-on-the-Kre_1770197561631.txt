You are a senior full-stack engineer working on the Kreate&Co codebase (Brand Portal + Admin). Implement the following changes end-to-end (frontend, backend APIs, database/schema if needed). Keep existing behavior unless explicitly removed. Ensure authorization is enforced server-side.

Global engineering requirements
	•	Maintain consistent UI patterns with existing components.
	•	Add loading, empty, and error states.
	•	Add validation for required fields and enums.
	•	Update TypeScript types across FE/BE.
	•	If DB migrations are needed, include SQL migrations and update any Supabase schema definitions.
	•	Do not break auth, routing, or existing dashboards.

⸻

1) Brand Portal → Campaigns list filters

Remove
	•	Remove the “platform” filter from the campaigns list UI and query logic.

Add
	•	Add a “Brand” filter:
	•	Dropdown of brands the user can access.
	•	When selected, campaigns list shows only campaigns for that brand.
	•	Update API query to accept brandId (or equivalent) and filter server-side.

⸻

2) Create Campaign wizard updates

Add a step: Brand is New or Existing
	•	Step: “Is this brand new or existing?”
	•	Existing → select brand from dropdown (required).
	•	New → inline create brand (minimum: brand name required). Create brand first, then create campaign associated to it.
	•	Ensure campaign cannot be created without a brand association.

Remove budget range
	•	Remove any “budget range” fields from UI, payload, validation, and DB.
	•	If there is a single budget field already used elsewhere, keep only if still required; otherwise remove budget entirely.

Add “Deal Type” field
	•	Field: dealType enum: collab, paid, mix (required).

Add “Campaign Package” field (conditional)

Add packageType and packageValue:

If Influencer campaign:
	•	10 videos / 15 videos / 20 videos / 40 videos / Other (+ required textbox)

If UGC campaign:
	•	4 videos / 8 videos / 12 videos / 20 videos / Other (+ required textbox)

If Hybrid campaign:
	•	Buzz bundle (4 UGC, 10 influencer)
	•	Hype bundle (8 UGC, 15 influencer)
	•	Impact bundle (12 UGC, 25 influencer)
	•	Viral campaign (20 UGC, 40 influencer)

Validate:
	•	If “Other” selected, textbox required.

Creator types update (only influencer/hybrid)
	•	Remove “creators needed” everywhere (UI/API/DB).
	•	Replace “creator type” with multi-select:
	•	nano influencers
	•	micro influencers
	•	mid tier
	•	macro
	•	Do NOT show creator type if campaign is UGC only.
	•	Persist as array of enums.

Campaign objectives update

Replace objectives with multi-select enum:
	•	awareness
	•	sales
	•	launch
	•	content bank
Persist as array of enums.

Platforms update
	•	Remove YouTube from platforms everywhere (constants, UI, API validation, DB enums).
	•	Ensure legacy YouTube values do not crash UI.

Content format update
	•	Remove “live” from content format options.
	•	Handle legacy “live” gracefully.

⸻

3) Campaign Details: “fancy normal” full page showing all information

Replace the current tabbed/fragmented view

When a user clicks a campaign, open a normal full details page (not a tab-only experience). The page should present all campaign information in a visually “fancy” but clean layout using cards/sections.

Layout requirements
	•	Page header:
	•	Campaign name
	•	Brand name
	•	Status pill (if exists)
	•	Quick actions (Edit, Archive, etc. only if already supported)
	•	Below header: content in sections/cards with clear grouping.

Sections to show (all available fields)
	1.	Overview
	•	Campaign type (UGC / Influencer / Hybrid)
	•	Deal type (collab / paid / mix)
	•	Start date
	•	Objectives (chips)
	2.	Package
	•	Package selection (Influencer/UGC/Bundle)
	•	If “Other”, show the custom text
	3.	UGC Requirements (only if campaign includes UGC)
	•	Persona
	•	Gender
	•	Age range
	•	Number of videos (or derived from package if you chose to derive)
	4.	Influencer Requirements (only if campaign includes influencer)
	•	Creator types (multi-select chips)
	•	Niche
	•	Platforms (no YouTube)
	•	Any budget field ONLY if still present
	5.	Creator Network (embedded as a section on the same details page)
	•	Rename “Creators” → “Creator Network”
	•	Show recommended creators list/grid with:
	•	approve/reject + rejection reason (if still part of spec)
	•	creator status field (brief sent / filming / posted / need alternative)
	•	“Add submitted content” button per creator
	•	Submitted content list per creator
	•	Final uploaded link per creator/content item (used for analytics)
	•	Include filters (Pending/Approved/Rejected + search) if already requested earlier.

UX: left panel should NOT be affected by scrolling
	•	The app’s left sidebar/navigation must remain fixed/sticky and not scroll with the page content.
	•	Only the main content area scrolls.
	•	Implement using CSS layout:
	•	Sidebar: position: sticky or fixed container with its own height, top: 0, overflow: hidden (or auto only if sidebar items exceed height)
	•	Main content: scroll container

Routing
	•	Campaign list → click campaign → /campaigns/:id renders this full details page.
	•	If old tab routes exist, redirect to the new details page anchor sections if needed.

Acceptance:
	•	Campaign details page shows all information in a clean “executive summary” style.
	•	Creator Network appears as a section on the details page.
	•	Sidebar stays fixed while user scrolls campaign details.

⸻

4) Creator Network naming + content submission

Rename
	•	Rename “Creators” to “Creator Network” across UI, routes, components.

Submitted content + status

For each campaign creator:
	•	Editable status: brief sent / filming / posted / need alternative
	•	Button: “Add submitted content” (modal):
	•	content link (required URL)
	•	platform (enum, no YouTube)
	•	content format/type (without live)
	•	optional notes
	•	“Final uploaded link” field for analytics (store on submission or creator-campaign join).

Unify creator search filters:
	•	Creator search must reuse the same filter component/query logic as Creator Network.

⸻

5) Signup gating: remove content queue review
	•	Remove logic that blocks new users due to “content queue review”.

⸻

6) Admin roles and access control

Implement two admin roles:
	1.	Super Admin: full access.
	2.	Employee Admin: only Campaigns + Creator Network.

Enforce in frontend navigation + backend authorization.

⸻

7) Deliverables
	•	FE + BE + DB updates.
	•	Update enums/constants/types.
	•	Add minimal tests or smoke checks if the repo supports it.
	•	Ensure no console errors and legacy data doesn’t crash UI.

Proceed to implement now.
