You are a senior frontend/full-stack engineer working on the Kreate&Co Brand Portal. Update the Campaigns page to be a list view (not cards), with a clean “fancy but normal” table-like layout. Keep existing functionality unless explicitly removed.

1) Campaigns page layout = List View
	•	Replace card/grid layout with a single list/table view:
	•	Each campaign is one row.
	•	Rows are clickable to open /campaigns/:id (campaign details page).
	•	Keep a top toolbar area for actions + filters.

2) Columns (left → right)

Each row should display:
	1.	Campaign Name (primary text)
	2.	Brand (brand name)
	3.	Campaign Kind (UGC / Influencer / Hybrid)
	4.	Deal Type (collab / paid / mix)
	5.	Start Date (formatted)
	6.	Package (label, e.g. “Buzz bundle” / “10 videos” / “Other: …” truncated)
	7.	Status (pill/badge if status exists; otherwise hide column)
	8.	Last Updated (optional if you track it; otherwise hide)

Row actions (right side):
	•	Kebab menu or inline buttons (only actions that already exist, e.g., Edit / Archive / Delete). If actions don’t exist, don’t invent them.

3) Filters + toolbar behavior
	•	Remove platform filter completely.
	•	Add Brand filter dropdown:
	•	Shows brands user can access.
	•	Filtering must be applied server-side via brandId query param.
	•	Add Search input (if you already have search; otherwise implement simple client search on loaded rows).
	•	Add “Create campaign” button on the right (opens the existing create campaign wizard modal).

4) Sorting + pagination
	•	Default sort: Start date (newest first) or Last updated (newest first) depending on what the system already supports.
	•	If API supports pagination, keep it and render table pagination controls.
	•	If no pagination exists, implement “Load more” or basic pagination only if easy—otherwise keep current behavior.

5) UX polish
	•	Sticky header row for the list (optional but preferred).
	•	Hover state on rows.
	•	Empty state:
	•	“No campaigns found” + suggestion to clear filters + Create button.
	•	Loading skeleton rows while fetching.
	•	Keep responsive behavior:
	•	On mobile: collapse less important columns into a secondary line under the campaign name.

6) API / types
	•	Ensure the list query returns the fields needed for the columns:
	•	campaign name, brand name/id, type (ugc/influencer/hybrid), dealType, startDate, package, status, updatedAt.
	•	If missing, extend the API response and update types accordingly.

Acceptance criteria
	•	Campaigns page is clearly a list/table view.
	•	Platform filter is gone.
	•	Brand filter works.
	•	Clicking a row opens campaign details.
	•	Create campaign still works from this page.
	•	No UI regressions, console errors, or broken routes.

Implement now.
